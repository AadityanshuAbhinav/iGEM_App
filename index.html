					<p>Team IGEM is a group of individuals passionate about the fascinating field of synthetic biology. They participate in the <a href="https://igem.org/" style="color: white;">iGEM</a> competition every year. For a competition so entirely steeped in innovation, collaboration, and education, the words ‘International Genetically Engineered Machine’ doesn’t quite portray the reality of things – the only machines at work here are the small, yet incredibly complex bundles of life growing on a Petri plate (and very occasionally, our brains)!</p>
					<p>The iGEM competition began in 2003 as a month-long course at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. It eventually expanded over the years, with around 450 teams taking part in the 2019 edition. IIT-Madras has a long history with iGEM as well, having taken part in more than 10 editions since 2008, and has received many accolades at the international stage including, four gold medals, five silver medals, the Best Foundational Advance project, and Best New BioBrick Part or Device, Engineered in 2008, A Safety Commendation, Asia in 2011, Best New BioBrick Part, Natural, Asia in 2011, Best Human Practices Advance, Asia in 2013 and a nomination for Best Education and Public Engagement in 2019.</p>
